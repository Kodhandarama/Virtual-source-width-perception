In experiment one,
design is the same
 
Draw speaker array

(write stimuli table)

explain references:

formants were obtained through LP analysis of natural vowel

expt 2:

to study the SNR levels required to delocalise a synthetic vowel

write stimuli table

explain stimuli
where Vnsigma denotes that vowel v is synthesised with 
the formant bandwidth at each formant frequency scaled by a factor of 'n'


explain results:
As the bandwidth increases, the SNR required to delocalise the vowel increases.
Effect of each formant :

instead of changing formant bandwidths at all frequencies, we changed the formant bandwidth for one formant and saw the effect.



Apparent source width is the aurally perceived extent of a sound source. 
The impression results from several auditory cues, which are affected by sound radiation characteristics of the source itself and by characteristics of the room.



Applications of study of Auditory source width

Wide sources are desired by listeners of music because these are associated with sound of acoustic music, opera, classical music, historically informed performance.
Source width is one of the perception cues that is lost when a person suffers hearing loss. Understanding and quantizing ASW will help in improving design of auditory experiments and hearing aids.
